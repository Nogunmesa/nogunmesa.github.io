        <h2>What is Identity?</h2>
        <p>Identity is a complex and dynamic concept. It includes the labels we assign ourselves and those that society assigns to us. Identity is shaped by various factors, such as race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual identity, ability, and culture.
            These characteristics intersect to form our unique eperience in the world.
            Understanding identity is key to understanding the diversity of human experience. Every person’s identity shapes how they see themselves and how others interact with them.

    <!-- Intersectionality Section -->
    <section id="intersectionality" class="section">
        <h2>Understanding Intersectionality</h2>
        <p><b>What is Intersectionality?</b>Intersectionality refers to the way different aspects of a person's identity combine to create unique experiences of discrimination and privilege. 
            For example, the experience of a 'black woman' is different from that of a 'white woman' or a 'black man' because her identity is shaped by both her race and her gender.</p>
        <p>Intersectionality highlights that we can’t fully understand issues like racism or sexism unless we look at how they intersect. This concept is critical to promoting equity and inclusivity in diverse spaces.</p>

        <h2>Ethics, Cultural Competence, and Inclusion</h2>
        <p>Ethics is about making decisions that respect the dignity and rights of others. In diverse settings, ethical decision-making requires cultural competence—understanding the cultural backgrounds and experiences of others and how these affect interactions.</p>
        <p>Diversity and inclusion go hand-in-hand with ethics. Organizations that value diversity aim to include different perspectives in decision-making, ensuring that all voices are heard. But diversity isn’t just about having different people in the room; it’s about creating an environment where those differences are respected and celebrated.</p>
        <p>Cultural competence involves recognizing our own biases, actively listening, and continually educating ourselves about cultures and identities that are different from our own.</p>

        <h3>How History Shapes the Present</h3>
        <p>
            History has had a profound impact on organizational cultures and the development of technology. 
            From exclusionary practices in hiring to the development of tools that only cater to certain groups, 
            these trends have affected who gets to succeed and who is left behind.
        </p>
        <p>
            One example is the role of women in technology. Historically excluded from STEM fields, women have 
            fought for a place at the table, changing the landscape of science and innovation today.
